# **Frontend Coding Challenge**

This is a project task to test frontend skills.

I developed my version of this project using React, and TailwindCSS as the CSS framework.

This project has a complex Layout which will leave anyone stunned at first, but I used Grid for the general Layouts and FlexBox for the secondary and to place items on same axis.

## Instructions on running the code

1. Clone this repo 
`git clone <repo>`

2. Run Npm install inside the repo directory to install all the depencies 
`npm install` or `yarn install`

3. Start the app using
`npm run dev` or  `yarn dev`

### Voila!! it is now open in your browser
